One of the strong assets of the Martini force field is its easy availability. Here, we provide resources including parameter files, example run parameters, and example topology files, all in
[<img src="images/gromacs.png" width="75" height=auto />](http://www.gromacs.org/) format, making it straightforward to set up and run your simulations. Additionally, Martini has been implemented in other molecular dynamics software packages (such as [<img src="images/namd.jpeg" width="95" height=auto/>](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/2.8/ug/node26.html) and [<img src="images/openmm.png" width="55" height=auto/><img src="images/openmm.jpeg" width="20" height=auto/>](https://github.com/maccallumlab/martini_openmm)), broadening its accessibility.

To further support your research, we offer starting structures derived from published example applications. These resources enable users to replicate and build upon established studies with ease. Moreover, we have curated a collection of scripts and programs developed by the Martini community over the years. These tools are designed to simplify the setup and analysis of Martini systems.
